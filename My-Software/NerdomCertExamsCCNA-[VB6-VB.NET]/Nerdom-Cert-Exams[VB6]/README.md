## Description

*This is software that I used to sell online on eBay back in the day. I created it for IT Certification Practice Exams for Cisco CCNA and more. It has tons of questions and even a mini router simulator (text based - not a real router). You can open the project only in Visual Basic 6 which runs in Windows XP or a VM. Exams are in the exams folder*
